# What is csvtui?

csvtui is a simple command line interface for viewing and working with CSV files. Its intended to give you a quick and simple way to view csv information, traverse a csv file, and interact with the contents. csvtui is not a complete csv toolkit, rather a lightweight tool designed to fit in developer workflows by allowing one to check and read csv files without context changing from your terminal

# how does csvtui work?

csvtui uses a combination of charm packages (notably lipgloss, bubbletea, and various 'bubbles') to display and navigate across csv files, and to apply styling. Editing is availble for individual cells.
